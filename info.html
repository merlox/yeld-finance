				<p>
					In traditional yield farming applications the users are rewarded
					from automatic portfolio rebalancing systems by updating daily each
					users' assets to buy the highest APY every day. In yeld.finance not
					only you get the best APY every day but you get rewarded for your
					YELD token holdings even after you've finished staking.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h2>Strategies</h2>
				<p>
					You start by depositing as many stablecoins as you want to stake on
					the system. Suppose on the first day your DAI holdings are
					generating a 17% APY on Aave. When that APY innevitably drops, say
					on day 5, your porfolio will be rebalanced by moving those DAI using
					a Smart Contract to the highest performer of that day which could be
					Compound or similar exactly at 12am CEST. Initially we will support
					dYdX, Aave, Uniswap, Compound and Curve.fi. The contract is
					self-controlling meaning it automatically detects the APY changes
					and updates users portfolios.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whenever you generate yield from staking your stablecoins, you
					automatically generate YELD tokens. Daily 100 YELD tokens will be
					distributed to yield farmers depending on how much profit they have
					created. This extra YELD farm will last for the initial 100 days.
					That amount is increased 10x for the first 3 days after the app is
					live. So if the total daily yield is 60,000 USD worth of stablecoins
					and your tokens generated 500 USD in yield, you'll get a 0.83% of
					the 100 YELD distributed daily, 0.83 YELD tokens in a single day. 
					Or 8.3 for the first 3 days.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h2>Algorithms</h2>
				<p>
					We use a new Buy and Burn algorithm where we split the daily yield
					generated by users in half to automatically buy ETH and exchange it
					for YELD tokens on Uniswap. Then, those YELD tokens are burned to
					reduce the total supply. When that happens, token holders will see
					an inmediate increase in YELD value to supplement their investments
					since a smaller supply increases the price.
				</p>
				<p>
					While normal supply reducing systems burn tokens to reduce the
					supply and wait for the market to self-adjust after several token
					exchanges, our Buy and Burn system directly updates the price right
					away since the purchased tokens modify the pair balance ratio on
					Uniswap. Resulting in a price increase, instantly.
				</p>
				<p>
					The result is an extremely efficient yield economy that rebalances
					and updates prices minute by minute without requiring user
					intervention.The most advanced type of yield farming to benefit
					users above all.
				</p>
				<p>
					A 1% of the total yield is taken and distributed to Retirement Yield
					farmers, explained below.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h2>Retirement Yield</h2>
				<p>
					Our largest goal is to reward token holders even after they are done
					staking and they've extracted their tokens from the dApp. The way we
					do it is simple: if user A has staked any stablecoins in the dApp
					for at least 1 day, he'll benefit from a lifetime of rewards paid in
					ETH. User A will become a Retirement Yield Farmer.
				</p>
				<p>
					How much the user gets depends entirely on his daily holdings. The
					larger percentage of the total supply you hold, the more you earn
					every day based on the daily yield profits from the collective
					farmers. We call this system The Retirement Yield.
				</p>
				<p>
					Compared to traditional yield farming systems, you don't need to
					lock your tokens permanentely in the system to keep earning. You get
					rewarded for being a holder every day regardless of whether you're
					staking or not. Furthemore, holders benefit from price increases
					from our Buy and Burn system.
				</p>

				<h2>Technicals</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Total supply: 60,000 YELD tokens.</li>
					<li>Will be made available on Uniswap.</li>
					<li>
						Where 20,000 YELD tokens will be locked for daily
						rewards.
					</li>
					<li>Another 30,000 tokens will be sold on the token sale. 
						The price will be 1 ETH = 40 YELD. Unsold tokens will be burned</li>
					<li>
						The remaining YELD will be made available on Uniswap,
						governance, development, auditing and other use cases.
					</li>
					<li>

				</ul>
				<hr />
				<h2>Codebase</h2>
				<p>
					Our contracts will be modified from the yearn finance contracts to
					implement our innovative Buy and Burn system, Retirement Yield
					algorithm and token redistribution systems. Available once audited
					to increase your safety.
